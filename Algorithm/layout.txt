The first practical mechanized type casting machine was invented in 1884 by Ottmar Mergen­ thaler. His invention was called the ”Linotype”. It produced solid lines of text cast from rows of matrices. Each matrice was a block of metal – usually brass – into which an impression of a letter had been engraved or stamped. The line-composing operation was done by means of a keyboard similar to a typewriter. A later development in line composition was the ”Teletypewriter”. It was invented in 1913. This machine could be attached directly to a Linotype or similar machines to control composition by means of a perforated tape. The tape was punched on a separate keyboard unit. A tape-reader translated the punched code into electrical signals that could be sent by wire to tape-punching units in many cities simultaneously. The first major news event to make use of the Teletypewriter was World War I.
